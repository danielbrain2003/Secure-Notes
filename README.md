Our project is a Secure Notes-taking and Todo Web Application designed to offer users a comprehensive solution for managing both their notes and tasks. In addition to providing a secure platform for note-taking, this application includes a Todo functionality to help users organize and track their tasks efficiently. With enhanced security measures, our application ensures that all user data, including notes and task lists, remains protected against unauthorized access.
